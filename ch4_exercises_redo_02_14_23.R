#4E1.In the model definition below, which line is the likelihood?

#the likelihood function is yi ~ Normal*mu, sigma)
#mu ~ Normal(0, 10) & sigma ~Uniform(0, 10) are both priors that initialize the likelihood.

#4E2. In the model definition just above, how many parameters are in the posterior distribution?

#in the moel definition, there are 2 parameters in the posterior distribution, mu & sigma.

#4E3. Using the model definition above, write down the appropriate form of Bayesâ€™ theorem that
includes the proper likelihood and priors.

#Pr((mu, sigma) | y) = Normal(yi| mu,sigma)*Normal(mu |178,20)*uniform(sigma,0, 50)/ SUM( Normal(yi| mu,sigma)*Normal(mu |178,20)*uniform(sigma,0, 50) )

#4E4.. In the model definition below, which line is the linear model?

#mu_i = a+ b*x_i is the linear model.

#4E5. In the model definition just above, how many parameters are in the posterior distribution?

# 2 parameters, mu & sigma are in the posterior distribution

#4M1. For the model definition below, simulate observed heights from the prior (not the posterior)
sample_mu <- rnorm( 1e4 , 0 , 10 )
sample_sigma <- runif( 1e4 , 0 , 10 )
prior_h <- rnorm( 1e4 , sample_mu , sample_sigma ) #simulate random heights from sampling the mu & sigma

#4M2. Translate the model just above into a map formula
sim_model <- map(
	alist( y_i ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		 mu ~ dnorm(0,10),
		 sigma ~ dunif(0,10)
		), data=d)

#4M3.Translate the map model formula below into a mathematical model definition.

#	y ~ Normal(mu_i, sigma),
#	mu_i <- a + b*x_i,
#	a ~ Normal(0, 50),
#	b ~ Uniform(0, 10),
#	sigma ~ Uniform(0,50)

#4M4. A sample of students is measured for height each year for 3 years. After the third year, you want
to fit a linear regression predicting height using year as a predictor. Write down the mathematical
model definition for this regression, using any variable names and priors you choose. Be prepared to
defend your choice of priors

h_i ~ Normal( mu_i, sigma)
mu_i <- a + b*x_i
#the population of students from kindergarten to highschool 
#have an average height in the following range (112, 173) 3 ft 8 to 5ft 8, average=143
#a ~ Normal(143,30) 143 cm +/- 30 cm, 95% of heights of students range from 83cm to 203cm
#b ~ Normal(4,2), on average across all ages students under 18 grow at 4cm/year, (7cm/yr at 5years of age,  0.5cm/yr at 18 years of age) , 
#95% of rates fall within 0cm/yr to 8cm/yr.
#sigma(0, 50) #weak prior, 95% of predicted heights students can range from 43cm to 243cm, captures a wide range of student heights.

4M5.Now suppose I tell you that the average height in the first year was 120 cm and that every
student got taller each year. Does this information lead you to change your choice of priors? How?

#the average height on the first year = 120cm, translate to 4ft, which a height common for elementary aged students at age 6-7
#i can change the priors:
# a ~ Normal(130.5,10)  - captures the average height of a student at the third year growing at at rate of 5.5cm/yr starting at 120cm on the first year,
# 				reduce sigma to capture heights of elementary school aged students only 95% of heights fall within 110cm to 150cm.
#
#
# b ~ Normal(5.5, 0.5cm)		- elementary aged students have a growth rate of 5-6 cm /year on average, 95% of rates fall between 4.5cm/yr to 6.5cm/yr
#
#
#
#sigma ~ Uniform(0,15) - reduce sigma so 95% of predicted heights fall within +/- 30cm of the mean (101cm, 160cm)



#4M6.. Now suppose I tell you that the variance among heights for students of the same age is never
more than 64cm. How does this lead you to revise your priors?

#variance is the square of sigma, so sigma never more than 8
#i can change the prior for sigma: sigma~Uniform(0, 8), 
#for the predicted heights, 95% of predicted heights will fall within 16cm of the mean.
#Since the prediction interval is larger than the uncertainty on the average, the sigma on the alpha prior can be adjusted, however I am not confident in the adjustment.
