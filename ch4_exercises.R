#4M.5 average height in the first year was 120cm , students got taller each year

#If the average height in the first year was 120cm, 
#I will change the prior for alpha ~ Normal(120,10) so the MAP will start at 120.
#This makes me more confident we are talking about elementary school students.
#Thus I can narrow the range of my prior distributions to account for heights and growth rates of elementary students instead
alpha ~ N( 120,10 ), #school age students fall between (100cm to 140cm 2 stdev)
beta ~ N( 7,1) #the growth rate of school aged students are higher, therefore we center at an average of 7cm/year
sigma ~ uniform(0,20) #reduce the sigma of the distribution as a higher sdev is less likely.

#4M6: The variance among heights for students of the same age is never more than 64cn. 
#How does this lead you to revise your priors?
